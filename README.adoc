= JaKot Data for Apache Solr (based on expired Spring Data Solr)

After the termination of Solr support by https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data], it was decided to continue further development of the library within this fork.

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-solr[JaKot Data Solr] continues to support Apache Solr using the development approaches proposed by https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data].

For the current version of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-solr[JaKot Data Solr], you can still use the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/solr/docs/current/reference/html/[documentation of Spring Data Solr].
